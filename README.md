# Professional Website Project

✨ **Luciano's Services PWA** ✨

## Overview
I am proud to announce the successful development, hosting, and sale of my first professional website. This project provided valuable experience in web development and cloud infrastructure management, specifically utilizing AWS services such as **S3 Buckets**, **CloudFront**, and **Route 53**.

Additionally, this was my first fully responsive **Progressive Web Application (PWA)**, built with **React**. I took on the full lifecycle of the project, from purchasing the domain to handling hosting, with the goal of creating a simple yet elegant presentation site to showcase the client’s goals and services. I believe I successfully achieved this objective while gaining practical knowledge along the way.

## Features
- **Fully Responsive PWA**: Built with React, the site is optimized for both desktop and mobile users, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **AWS Integration**: Hosted via AWS S3 Bucket with content delivery handled by CloudFront. DNS management is performed through Route 53, providing reliability and scalability.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Integrated into the website to enhance visibility and attract more clients for the business.
- **Custom Design and Photography**: Collaborated with designers and photographers to align the site’s visuals with the company’s branding and vision.

## Project Management
One of the highlights of this project was the opportunity to manage the entire process from concept to execution. I worked directly with the client to understand their needs, pitched the importance of an online presence, and demonstrated how the site would help improve their business by increasing client engagement.

I also collaborated closely with design and photography teams to ensure the website matched the client’s goals and aesthetic preferences. Integrating **Google Maps** into the site provided an added layer of customer accessibility, enhancing their online presence.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: AWS S3 for static hosting, AWS CloudFront for content delivery
- **Domain Management**: AWS Route 53
- **Other**: Google Maps API, PWA (Progressive Web App) integration

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Gained hands-on experience with AWS services, particularly in managing S3 Buckets, CloudFront distributions, and Route 53 for domain routing.
- **Responsive Design**: Developed my first fully responsive PWA, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Client Management**: Successfully pitched the idea of the website to the client, managed expectations, and delivered a product that aligned with their business goals.

## Looking Ahead
This project has been an excellent learning opportunity, and I'm excited to take on future challenges in web development and project management. Special thanks to **Pedro** for working through AWS integration with me!
